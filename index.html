					<h2><a href="#">What is 3_D maze?</a></h2>
									
					<p> Introduction to our final project of the first year at AlX School : 
					The Maze project is about doing a game with the SDL2 library in the C language, so basically a labyrinth game where you need to find the exit.So why did we choose such a project? It is just a labyrinth, 
					not even made with the bests free games engines like Unity or Unreal, well actually, i was thinking of doing an old looking game without a game engine.The purpose of this project for me is firstly, 
					to look at how it is possible to do a game without a game engine, secondly to learn the mathematics and physics behind it and finally, to remember the old days when they played at a game 
					like Wolfenstein 3D (only talking about graphisms here).The Maze project is inspired in the world of the famous video game Wolfenstein 3D, which is built from a grid of walls of uniform height that are 
					joined by solid colored floors and ceilings. To draw the world, a single ray is traced for each column of pixels on the screen and a vertical slice of the wall texture is selected and scaled according to 
					where in the world the lightning strikes a wall and what so far he travels before he does. This project does not intend to build an exact replica of the video game or match it in complexity, but to generate
					the basic infrastructure to obtain an approximate model in the projection of the game environment and the playerâ€™s movement.

			               <p> It is ALX default portfolio project that enables a student to create a game in 3D using raycasting. 
					 Ray-casting is a techniques that transform a limited form of data into a 3D projection by tracing rays from the view point to the viewing volume.</p>
